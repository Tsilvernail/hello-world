# hello-world
just a little thingy doodler
I new to programming. I am learning on my own as I can't afford the luxury of paying for school. I have a wife and two children. I am commited to becoming extremely proficient at programming, specifically front end web development. However, I want to learn other types of programming as well, it just won't be my main focus.

My goal is to have an entry level programming job, or my first paid free lance project,  within 16 months.
